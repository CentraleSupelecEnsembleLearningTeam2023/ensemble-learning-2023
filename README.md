# New York City Airbnb Price Prediction

## Introduction 
This is the course project for Ensemble Learning at CentraleSup√©lec, 2023. Airbnb has become a popular alternative to traditional hotels and has disrupted the hospitality industry. Through Airbnb, individuals can list their own properties as rental places. In New York City
alone, there are around 40,000 listings. While traditional hotels have teams that carefully measure
demand and supply to adjust pricing, as a host, it can be challenging to determine the optimal price
for a listing. The variation in types of listings can also make it difficult for renters to get an accurate
sense of fair pricing. In this project, we will use ensemble learning methods to predict the price of
Airbnb listings in New York City.

## Data 
The data set for this project is obtained from Kaggle and contains the listings in New York City in
2019. The data set includes 15 features on listings, including:
- Name of the listing
- Neighborhood
- Price
- Review information
- Availability

The data set contains around 47,000 listings. You can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data).

## Project Tasks
- Pre-processing and EDA
- Apply all approaches taught in the course and practiced in lab sessions (Decision Trees, Bagging,
Random forests, Boosting, Gradient Boosted Trees, AdaBoost, etc.) on this data set. The goal
is to predict the target variable: price of the listing.
- Compare performances of models using various metrics learned in class.
